# Lab 9 - Introduction to Azure

## Lab Preparation

### Purpose / Objectives of Lab 9

In this lab, you will login to **Microsoft Azure** for the first time, navigate your way to DevTest Labs, and spin up two VM images. The main purpose of this lab is to learn how to create Windows virtual machines in the cloud using a pre-built image, how to remotely connect to each, and basic management of these VMs from the Azure web interface.

While you are working through this lab, it is highly recommended that you write down general notes and commands to help you remember how to do this lab. You may use your notes during tests, so fill it out accordingly!

If you encounter technical issues, please contact your professor via e-mail or in your section's Microsoft Teams group.

### Minimum Requirements ###

Before beginning, you must have:

1. Read these notes AND the invitation Blackboard message on how to connect the first time.
1. Your Seneca login credentials.
1. A computer with an Internet connection. (Windows/macOS/Linux)
1. A mobile device (phone/tablet) to setup 2FA (two-factor authentication).
1. Your copy of the OSM620 Lab Logbook.

## Investigation 1: Connecting to Your Azure Account

In this investigation, you'll log in to your Seneca-provided Azure account and ensure you have access to our DevTest Labs digital classroom.

### Part 1: Logging In For The First Time

1. **Follow the link to our DevTest Lab e-mailed to you via Blackboard.**
1. Enter your Seneca credentials. (Same username and password you use for your e-mail)
1. You'll next be asked to set up two-factor authentication. Do not bypass this step!
1. Once you've set that up, verify it by logging out and logging back in again.
1. Conduct a small celebration (pat on the back, a quick jig, perhaps a fist pump) and move on to Investigation 2.

### Part 2: Logging In Afterwards

Logging in after initial setup is quite easy.

1. Navigate to the Azure portal: `https://portal.azure.com`
1. Use your Seneca credentials.
1. Complete 2FA authentication.
1. Our classroom DevTest Lab will be in your recent list, or you can use the search bar to bring up DevTest Labs by looking for **OSM620**.

> **WARNING**  
> *DO NOT search for *Virtual Machines* in the search bar.* You will find yourself in the wrong area and things will not work.

## Investigation 2: Managing a Windows Server 2025 VM in Azure

In this investigation, you'll create, configure, and manage a Windows Server 2022 Virtual Machine using Microsoft Azure and a pre-built image. This means no tedious and time-consuming Windows installation! You'll also login to the VM remotely using Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol to share its desktop.

**This can be done from any normal computer**. No local VMs required.

### Part 1: Creating A Windows VM From An Image

To create your Windows Server 2025 Virtual machine, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to *DevTest Labs > OSM620 > My virtual machines*
1. Click the **+ Add** button.
1. Wait for the *Choose a base* listing to populate. This may take a few moments.
1. Select the item titled **Windows Server 2025 Datacenter**. Be careful here! There are many other options.
1. A new blade, *Create lab resource* appears.

    ![Image: Azure - Create Lab Resource](/img/azure-vm-labresource.png)

1. In the *Virtual machine name* field, type: **az-srv##** (you have been assigned a 2-digit UID, found in gradebook. Use that. Example: az-srv11)
1. *Username:* **yourSenecaUsername**
1. *Use a saved secret:* Unchecked
1. *Password*: Your choice, but use the same for all VMs and resources in this course.
1. *Save as default password:* Checked.
1. *Virtual machine size*: **Standard_B2ms**
1. *OS disk type*: **Standard HDD**
1. Leave the remaining options as they are.
1. Click on the **Create** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. You are now back in the *My virtual machines* blade while Azure creates your personal virtual machine. This may take a few minutes.
1. When it finishes, you should see a **Your deployment is complete.** message near the top of the page. Congratulations!
1. Click on the **Go to resource** button at the bottom left of the page and move on to the next section of the lab.

### Part 2: Accessing Your Windows Server VM Remotely Using RDP

In this section, we'll discover how to remotely connect to the Windows Server's desktop environment over the Internet from your computer. It's a very simple process.

1. In the *Overview* tab for the Virtual Machine created in Part 1, click the **Connect** button. This will download an RDP profile file (usually *vmname.rdp*).
1. Open the RDP file. It should launch the Remote Desktop application and automatically try to connect to your VM.
1. Upon opening, the VM's URL, port number, and username are automatically provided.

    ![Image: Windows RDP Dialog](/img/azure-rdp.png)

1. Type the password you used when creating the VM in Part 1.
1. Accept the certificate warning. (Click yes.)
1. You should see a login progress screen, and a Windows Server desktop after a few moments.
1. Congratulations! You've set up a Windows Server VM and logged in remotely.
1. Open Notepad, and write:

    ```test
    My name is *insertFullName*, and I've completed the Lab 1 Windows Server VM investigation!
    ```

1. Save the file to your VM's desktop, with the filename *yourSenecaUsername.txt*.
1. **Do not skip Part 3 at this stage! Otherwise, you'll be bleeding funds by leaving the VM running.**

### Part 3: Fully Stopping Your Windows Virtual Machine

This section is fairly simple. The one thing to never forget: Ensure your VM's status is set to **Stopped (Deallocated)**.

1. In the *Overview* blade of your Windows Server VM, click on the **Stop** button.
1. A notification will appear in the top right of your browser window, confirming your action.
1. Don't worry about going into the Windows OS and shutting down first. Azure sends a signal to the VM to shut down safely.
1. If your VM status says stopped, but does not include the **(Deallocated)** text, then resources are still being held by the VM and we're still being charged. The stop button will still be available, so click it.

## Investigation 3: Managing a Windows 11 VM in Azure

# Investigation 3: Managing an Ubuntu Linux VM in Azure

In this investigation, we'll create, configure, and manage a Windows 11 Virtual Machine using Microsoft Azure.

### Part 1: Creating An Ubuntu VM From An Image

To create your Ubuntu VM, follow the steps from *Investigation 2, Part 1*, but with the following settings:

1. **Choose a base:** Windows 11 Education
1. **Virtual machine name:** az-w7client## (Use 2-digit UID)
1. **User name:** yourSenecaUsername
1. **Authentication type:** Password
1. **Use a saved secret:** Unchecked
1. **Password:** Same as your Windows Server VM
1. **Save as default password:** Checked
1. **Virtual machine size:** Standard_B2ms
1. Leave all other options as they are.
1. Click **Create**!

When deployment is complete, click on the new VM in *My virtual machines* to verify its status and find the VM's address. Write this down.

### Part 2: Accessing Your Windows 11 VM Remotely Using RDP

In this section, we'll discover how to remotely connect to the Windows 11's desktop environment over the Internet from your computer. It's a very simple process.

1. In the *Overview* tab for the Virtual Machine created in Part 1, click the **Connect** button. This will download an RDP profile file (usually *vmname.rdp*).
1. Open the RDP file. It should launch the Remote Desktop application and automatically try to connect to your VM.
1. Upon opening, the VM's URL, port number, and username are automatically provided.

    ![Image: Windows RDP Dialog](/img/azure-rdp.png)

1. Type the password you used when creating the VM in Part 1.
1. Accept the certificate warning. (Click yes.)
1. You should see a login progress screen, and a Windows Server desktop after a few moments.
1. Congratulations! You've set up a Windows Server VM and logged in remotely.
1. Open Notepad, and write:

    ```test
    My name is *insertFullName*, and I've completed the Lab 1 Windows 11 Client VM investigation!
    ```

1. Save the file to your VM's desktop, with the filename *yourSenecaUsername.txt*.
1. **Turn off your VM after you're done. *Stopped (Deallocated)*.**

## Investigation 4: Managing Your VMs Directly Through Azure's UI

In this quick investigation, we'll walk through how to directly manage virtual machines from the Azure Dashboard interface on a basic level. This is useful for starting up VMs, shutting them down when unresponsive, and deleting them when you're finished. (**Warning:** Do not delete either VM created in this lab!)

> **IMPORTANT**  
> After creating your VMs for the first time, you must log out and log back in to Azure.
>
> When you first create a VM in DevTest Labs (DTL) and it's in a fully running state, you need to log out and log back into the Azure Portal for permissions to be added properly to your account.
>
> If you don't, you'll get *Permission denied* warnings from Azure if you try to do this investigation.

### Part 1: Powering On A Virtual Machine

From the *DevTest Labs* blade:

1. Click on the *My virtual machines* menu bar item.
1. Click on the virtual machine you'd like to manage to move to its *Overview* blade.
1. Click the **Start** menu button near the top.

### Part 2: Powering Off A Virtual Machine

From the *DevTest Labs* blade:

1. Click on the *My virtual machines* menu bar item.
1. Click on the virtual machine you'd like to manage to move to its *Overview* blade.
1. Click the **Stop** menu button near the top.

Remember the difference between the status *Stopped* and *Stopped (deallocated)*!

### Part 3: Restarting A Virtual Machine

There are two methods to restarting a VM. Either within the OS, or through the Azure Dashboard.

Inside the OS:

* Windows: Click on Start, and select Power Off.
* Linux: From the command line (SSH), type `sudo reboot`

In either OS, you will be disconnected from your remote session. Wait a few minutes while the VM restarts, and reconnect.

From Azure Dashboard:

1. Click on the **Restart** button from the VM's *Overview* blade.
1. Wait until the VM's status has changed to **Running** before logging back in.

### Part 4: Deleting A Virtual Machine

> **WARNING**  
> Do not actually do this! This is for informational purposes only.

Deleting a Virtual Machine is useful when you no longer need it long-term, or if there's a catastrophic issue with the OS inside. Be careful! Any saved data inside the VM will be deleted as well!

1. Navigate to the VM's *Overview* blade.
1. If the VM status isn't **Stopped (Deallocated)**, stop the VM. Wait until its status updates.
1. Click on the **Delete** button at the top of the blade.

### Part 5: A Note About Resource Usage

As throughout this lab, using resources responsibly is incredibly important. We pay for what we use. While we have a failsafe in place to stop all VMs at 2:00am EST daily, don't rely on it! Fully stop your VMs when you're not using them.

Your total allowed resource allocation has been restricted for this course. This means you can only have two VMs (or services) at a time. If you have two already, you won't be able to add another until you delete one.

## Investigation 5: Updating Windows via Azure

Updating your Windows VMs in Azure is *very easy*. It takes advantage of the cloud infrastructure to allow point-and-click updates.

### Part 1: Updating Windows Server 2025 with Artifacts

1. Spin up your Windows Server VM, and wait until it's fully started up.
1. In the Azure blade for your Windows Server VM, click on the **Artifacts** item in the menu bar to the left, within the **Operations** drop-down.
1. In this new window, click on the **Apply artifacts** button. This will bring you to the *Add artifacts* screen.
1. In the *Add artifacts* search field, type **Time**.
1. Click on **Set Time Zone** in the results listing, select *Eastern Standard Time* from the menu in the popup, then click **OK**.
1. You'll be returned to the *Add artifacts* window.
1. Add the following additional artifacts:
    1. Firefox
    1. Windows Firewall operations – Enable ICMP (Ping)
    1. Installs the latest Windows Updates

    ![Image: Lab 2 - Windows Artifacts](/img/lab2-artifacts.jpeg)

1. You'll be returned to the *Add artifacts* window with a list or artifacts waiting to be installed. Simply click **Install** to start the process them.
1. The *Artifacts* window will return, and a new entry for each artifact will appear. (You may need to click on the *Refresh* button next to *Apply artifacts.) Their statuses will cycle through *Pending*, *Installing*, and finally *Succeeded*.
1. This may take 10-20 minutes. However, you don't have to wait! You can move on to *Part 2* while this VM is running updates without having any impact on your other VM. Move to *Part 2* after reading the note below.

> **NOTE**  
> When all artifacts are in a *Succeeded* state, they've completed their tasks. You don't even have to remain logged into the VM or the Azure website. Check back later if you want.

### Part 2: Updating Windows 11 with Artifacts

Repeat *Part 1*'s steps, but on your Windows 11 VM.

That's it!
