# Lab 1 - Environment Setup

## Lab Preparations

### Purpose of Lab 1

In this lab you will stand up the base environment you’ll use for the course. You’ll obtain official installation media and keys, prepare VMware Workstation, and deploy two servers:

* srv1: **Windows Server 2025 Datacenter, GUI** (Desktop Experience)
* srv2: **Windows Server 2025 Datacenter, CLI** (Core)

You’ll complete essential post-install tasks (time zone, naming, activation, updates), then place both servers on a two-NIC layout so they can talk to each other on a private subnet while still reaching the internet for updates.

By the end, the machines are clean, consistent, and ready for later labs (Hyper-V, security hardening, DNS, DHCP, and eventually AD).

### Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

* Acquire **Windows Server 2025 Datacenter** installation media and your individual product key from Azure Education and store them securely.
* Access **VMware Workstation** on a Seneca lab PC (locally or via MyApps) or install it on a personal PC.
* Provision two VMs with the required specs and networks:
  * srv1-`senecaUsername` (GUI) with NAT + VMnet10 NICs.
  * srv2-`senecaUsername` (Core) with NAT + VMnet10 NICs.
* Complete essential post-install tasks on each server.
* Verify basic Internet connectivity prerequisites for later labs within each VM.

Here's a basic flowchart of what we'll be doing with Lab 1 to give you a visual overview:

> ![Fig 1. Lab 1 - Flowchart Visualization](/img/lab1-flowchart.png)

### Minimum Requirements

Before beginning, you must have:

1. Attended the Week 1 lecture.
2. Read through the Week 1 slides, and have them handy as a reference for concepts.
1. Working access to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) with your Seneca credentials.
1. Access to VMware Workstation (Seneca lab PC or personal PC meeting course specs).
1. Your external SSD with at least 500 GB of dedicated space for this course.
1. Your assigned **UID** (from Blackboard Grades) handy for addressing.
1. Your physically printed **OSM620 Lab Logbook** for notetaking and saving commands.
1. Optional, but recommended: Caffeine delivery system.

## Investigation 1: Downloading Installation Media

In this investigation, you will be downloading your Windows OS installation media by logging into your Seneca-based Azure account. You will also generate your personal serial keys.

1. Navigate to the Microsoft Azure site: [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
1. Use your Seneca e-mail address and password to login.
1. Once on the main Azure page, look for the Search bar at the top of the page.
1. In the Search bar, type: **Education**, then hit Enter.
1. In the **Education | Overview** page, look to the left. You will see menu items already displayed on screen. (*Overview*, *Learning resources*, etc.)
1. Inside **Learning resources** in the left menu, click on **Software**.
1. In the main **Software** page, there is a Search bar just below the word Software (it says *Search* inside it.)
1. In that search field, type and enter: **Windows Server 2025 Datacenter**
1. In the item that appears below (there should only be one), click the link for **Windows Server 2025 Datacenter**.
1. On the right, an information box appears describing the software. Using your mouse to hover over this information box, scroll down to the bottom.
1. You should now see two items: **View Key** and **Download**
1. Click on **Download** first to begin downloading the Server 2025 ISO. You will need this for your operating system installation. (Don't forget where you've saved it!)
1. While the ISO file is downloading, click on **View Key**.
1. Copy this key into a text file that you save locally on your personal computer or personal USB key. You will need this for the Server installation and for any reinstalls later in the semester. **Do not lose this key and do NOT share it with anyone!**
1. Repeat steps 8-14 for the **Windows 11 Education** ISO and serial key. You will need that for later.

> **Reminder:** Always store all serial keys in a secure location only you have access to.

## Investigation 2: Using VMware Workstation

The use of *VMware Workstation* is required for this course. You can either use a Seneca Lab computer (Option 1a / Option 1b) or a personal computer (Option 2).

If you use an external SSD, you can use both!

> **WARNING:** Seneca Lab computers erase any locally saved data when restarted from their internal drives. Save all work to an external drive or online storage.

### Option 1a: Seneca Lab Computers w/VMware Workstation Installed Locally

How do you know if your particular Seneca Lab classroom has VMware Workstation installed?

**When you log in, the VMware Workstation icon will be visible on the desktop.** If it is not, jump to *Option 1b*.

1. Log in to the Seneca workstation with your Seneca username (don't include @myseneca.ca) and password.
1. Once the desktop has fully loaded, double-click on the **VMware Workstation** icon on the desktop. (If not present, jump to *Option 1b* instructions.)
1. When the **VMware Workstation** application appears on screen, continue to the next Investigation.

### Option 1b: Seneca Lab Computers *without* VMware Workstation Installed

**Do not use this option if your lab computer already has *VMware Workstation* installed. Go back to *Option 1a*.**

1. Log in to the Seneca workstation with your Seneca username (don't include @myseneca.ca) and password.
1. Once the desktop has fully loaded, double-click on the **Seneca MyApps** icon on the desktop.
1. In the browser that launches, log in with your Seneca credentials.
1. Do not ignore dialog boxes! Read them carefully instead of just clicking *Cancel* or randomly.
1. In the search bar in the middle of the screen, type *VMware* and hit **Enter.**
1. One result should show up, **VMware WS Pro**. Click this result.
1. In the new *VMware WS Pro* page, click on the version number (Example: 17.6.1). This will launch the application over the network.
1. Click on allow for any dialog boxes that appear. Remember, **do not ignore dialog boxes!**
1. Be patient. It can take a bit for the background files to transfer over the network.
1. When complete, the **VMware Workstation** application should appear on screen. (You will also see the **VMware Workstation** icon on the desktop. You can launch it from here if you accidentally close the program.)
1. Proceed to the next investigation.

### Option 2: Personal Computer

#### Part 2: Registering Your Broadcom Account

Broadcom (formerly VMware) now requires account registration before you can download the VMware Workstation software. Follow the instructions below to do so. You only have to do this once. (If you already have an account using your Seneca e-mail, skip to Part 3.)

1. Visit the Broadcom registration site: profile.broadcom.com/web/registration
1. Provide your Seneca e-mail address and continue.
1. You will be sent a verification code. Check your Seneca e-mail and enter the code on the page.
1. On the *Complete your Registration* page, enter your information and click **Create Account.**
1. On the *Registered Successfully!* page, you can skip the rest and simply click **I'll do it later**.
1. At the top right of the screen, click on the **Login** button. (No, you aren't logged in automatically. Yes, it's annoying.)
1. Enter your Seneca e-mail address as your username and the password you chose on Part 4 as your credentials.
1. When complete, you should see your name in the top right of the screen instead of *Login.* If not, attempt to log in again or ask for help.

### Part 3: Downloading VMware Workstation

1. Go to this link: [Download VMware Workstation](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=VMware%20Workstation%20Pro&freeDownloads=true)

## Investigation 4: Post-Installation Tasks (*srv1*)

After installing a new operating system, there are always a number of **post-installation tasks** to complete. **These aren't optional!**

#### Overview Check-In: *srv1* Internet Connection

Let's take a quick look at an overview of our NAT Internet connection as it currently stands. It's important to understand how everything is connected.

> ![Fig 4. Lab 1, Investigation 4 - Network Diagram](/img/lab1-netdiag-srv1.png)

### Part 1: Applying Time Zone Settings

This one is fairly straight-forward. Having the proper time zone set (EST) is essential for proper time keeping and ensuring encrypted webpages connect properly.

1. In the *Server Manager* application, click on **Local Server** in the left-hand menubar.
1. In the main *Properties* area, on the right-hand column, look for the *Time Zone* line. It should say **(UTC-05:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada)**.
1. If the *Time Zone* line item doesn't say the above, click on the displayed time zone and change it to UTC-05:00 as seen above.

### Part 2: Server Name Change

The default name applied to your new server will be semi-randomized. For proper identification (and to not wonder which server you're on when you have several), we're going to change this.

1. In the *Server Manager* application, click on **Local Server** in the left-hand menubar.
1. In the main *Properties* area, on the left-hand column, look for the *Computer name* line.
1. Click the current computer name.
1. In the *System Properties* dialog box that pops up, find the **Change** button and click it. (Ignore the *Computer Description* field. It's tempting, but wrong!)
1. In the new *Computer Name/Domain Changes* dialog box that pops up, find the *Computer name* field. Replace it with **srv1-SenecaUsername**.
1. When you click **OK**, the system will warn you about restarting. Choose to restart the system when asked.
1. Once you've restarted and logged back in, go back to the *Server Manager* from Part 1 and double-check your new computer name is correct. **Do not skip this step!**
1. If it is, you're done!

### Part 3: Windows Activation

Activating Windows unlocks certain settings and features. Since you've used your valid serial key (right?), you can activate with Microsoft easily.

1. In the *Server Manager* application, click on **Local Server** in the left-hand menubar.
1. In the main *Properties* area, on the right-hand column, look for the *Product ID* line.
1. Click on the **Not activated** link.
1. Follow the instructions in the popup dialog box. If unable to activate easily, **ask your professor for help**.

### Part 4: Installing OS Updates

A critical part of a security-conscious mindset is running regular updates. **This is NOT something you do only once at the start of installation.** You should be running these regularly to keep up to date with security fixes and zero-day exploits.

1. If you're already in the *Settings* application, look through the left menubar for **Windows Update** and click it. (Otherwise, click on the *Start* menu and search for **Updates**.)
1. In the *Windows Update* main screen, scroll down to **Advanced Options** and click it.
1. The very first option is *Receive updates to other Microsoft products*. Toggle this from **Off** to **On**.
1. At the top of the screen, where it says *Windows Update > Advanced Options*, click **Windows Update** to go back to the previous screen.
1. You will likely already see updates ready. Click on **Download & install all**.
1. As you might expect, this can take a while. Timing will depend on your Internet connection, how fast your computer is, how fast your SSD is, and how many updates there are. Please be patient. Your computer may restart.
1. Once updates have begun, take a break while it does its thing. Grab a drink, make a sandwich, text a friend.
1. After updates are complete, go back into *Windows Update* and click **Check for updates** again. There may be (and often times are) more.
1. If there are more updates, complete Steps 5-8 again until there are no more updates available.
1. In *Windows Update*, scroll back down to **Advanced options** again and click it.
1. Inside *Windows Update > Advanced options* scroll down to **Optional updates** and click it.
1. Select all available updates that appear (you may have to expand some lists).
1. Click **Download & install**.
1. Once all updates are complete, restart your VM if asked, then move onto the next section.

### Part 5: Internet Connectivity Check w/Edge

We'll double-check we can access the Internet using the built-in Microsoft Edge application.

1. Open *Microsoft Edge*.
1. Go through the first-run questions.
1. When able, use the browser to navigate to **eff.org**.
1. If the website loads, move on to the next step. If not, **ask your professor for help**.

### Part 6: Download and Install Firefox

There are a ton of feature and privacy reasons *not* to use Microsoft Edge. Instead, we'll download and install **Mozilla Firefox** and use that going forward.

1. Open *Microsoft Edge*.
1. Navigate to: [Download Mozilla Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/en-CA/browsers/desktop/windows)
1. Wait for the installer to finish, then open it.
1. Follow the installer instructions.
1. Once complete, open *Firefox* and navigate to **eff.org** to check everything is okay.
1. Close *Microsoft Edge* forever.
